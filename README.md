# Bizarro Ball

## What Is It?

This repository contains the sample data used in the seminal book [Data Management Solutions Using SAS Hash Table Operations: A Business Intelligence Case Study](https://www.amazon.com/Management-Solutions-Using-Table-Operations/dp/1629601438) by [Paul Dorfman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauldorfman/) and [Don Henderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donaldjhenderson/).  More information on the incredible power of hashing can be found in their SGF2017 paper [Beyond Table Lookup: The Versatile SASÂ® Hash Object ](https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings17/0821-2017.pdf).


## Who Is It For?
Primarily this data is useful (and was prepared specifically) for readers of the aforementioned [book](https://www.amazon.com/Management-Solutions-Using-Table-Operations/dp/1629601438), however the authors have given permission for the data to be used for other purposes as well - such as testing, education, development, and demos.

Unlike the sample data in SASHELP, the Bizarro data can _modified_.  It also contains some interesting properties (such as md5 hashed indexes / surrogate keys).

## How Do I Use It?

For ease of extraction, the files are built into a single [bizarroball.sas](bizarroball.sas) file that can be easily copy pasted into a SAS session.

Simply modify the `root` variable (to a permanent path, if desired), and hit RUN.
